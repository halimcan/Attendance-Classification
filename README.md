# Attendance Classification with Random Forest and Logistic Regression

The project is dedicated to the task of predicting fitness class attendance using machine learning techniques. I leverage the power of Random Forest and Logistic Regression algorithms to create a robust predictive model and display a comparison of the algorithm performances. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and is aptly titled the 'Fitness Club Dataset for ML Classification.
